# ⚡️ Quickstart

### 📋 What you need before starting

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Discord App](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [LocalTunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel)

# 🚀 Running the app locally

> [!NOTE]
> These are instructions for running the *Discord bot server* locally, which connects a Letta server to Discord.
> If you're using Letta Cloud, all you'll need is your Letta Cloud API key + the Discord bot server, but if you're self-hosting, you'll also need to set up a Letta server.

## 💻 Grab a Letta API key

Follow the [quickstart guide](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart) to get your own Letta Cloud API key.

You can run your own Letta server using [Letta Desktop](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart/desktop) or [Docker](https://docs.letta.com/quickstart/docker).
If you're self-hosting a server, the Letta server will run on `http://localhost:8283` by default (that will be your `LETTA_BASE_URL`).

### 👾 Create your Letta agent

You can connect an existing agent to Discord (by using its `LETTA_AGENT_ID`), or you can create a brand new agent specifically to use as a Discord bot.

If you create a new agent, we'd recommend adding some information (e.g. inside of the `human` or `persona` memory block) that explains how to interact with Discord. For example, placing the following text in `human`:
```
I can use this space in my core memory to take notes on the users that I am interacting with.
So far, all I know that is that I am connected to a Discord server.
I can see messages that other users send on this server, as long as they are directed at me (with a mention or a reply).
I should also remember that if I want to "at" a user, I need to use the <@discord-id> format in my message response.
This will render the user tag in a dynamic way on Discord, vs any other reference to a user (eg their username) will just result in plaintext.
```

Additionally, if you would like to give your chatbot/agent the ability to "ignore" (not reply) to certain messages, you can add a custom tool like this to your agent (for information on how to add a custom tool, see [our docs](https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/tools#custom-tools)):
```python
def ignore():
    """
    Not every message warrants a reply (especially if the message isn't directed at you). Call this tool to ignore the message.
    """
    return
```

The ability for an agent to "ignore" messages can be crucial if you connect your agent to an active Discord channel with many participants, especially if you set `RESPOND_TO_GENERIC` to `true` (in which case the agent will "see" every single message in a channel, even messages not directed at the agent itself).

## 🚀 Run app

To run the app locally, simply do:
```bash
npm start
```

This will spin up the Discord bot service, which will listen for events on Discord, and when an event happens (e.g. a message is sent in a channel), it will send an appropriate message to the Letta server, check for a response from the Letta server, and potentially send back a reply message on Discord.

We have also prepared a one-click deploy option to easily deploy this repo on Railway.
Simply click the deploy link, enter your environment variables (including your Letta server address and Letta agent ID), and your Discord bot will be ready to go (and live 24/7):

## Advanced Features

### Message Types

The bot distinguishes between four message types, each with a different prefix format sent to the agent:

| Type | When it applies | Format |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **DM** | Direct message to the bot | `[username (id=123) sent you a direct message] message` |
| **MENTION** | Message @mentions the bot | `[username (id=123) sent a message in #channel mentioning you] message` |
| **REPLY** | Reply to bot's previous message | `[username (id=123) replied to you in #channel] message` |
| **GENERIC** | Other channel messages | `[username (id=123) sent a message in #channel] message` |

This context helps the agent understand where messages come from and respond appropriately.

### Conversation Context

The bot includes recent message history as context for the agent:

**Regular channels:**
- Fetches the last N messages (configured via `LETTA_CONTEXT_MESSAGE_COUNT`)
- Includes both user and bot messages
- Filters out command messages (starting with `!`)
- Format:
  ```
  [Recent conversation context:]
  - username1: message text
  - username2: message text
  [End context]

  [Current message from username]
  ```

**Threads:**
- Automatically detects thread messages
- Fetches thread starter and all replies (up to `LETTA_THREAD_MESSAGE_LIMIT`)
- Format:
  ```
  [Thread: "Thread name"]
  [Thread started by username: "original message"]

  [Thread conversation history:]
  - user1: message
  - user2: reply
  [End thread context]

  [Current message from user]
  ```

Thread context takes precedence over regular conversation history when in a thread.

### Message Handling

**Auto-splitting:** Messages longer than Discord's 2000 character limit are automatically split into multiple messages.

**Code block preservation:** When splitting, the bot preserves markdown code blocks, ensuring they aren't broken across messages.

**Code block isolation:** Code blocks are sent as separate messages for easy copying.

### Message Batching

When enabled, messages are accumulated before sending to the agent:

- Each channel has its own message buffer
- Batch drains when reaching `MESSAGE_BATCH_SIZE` or `MESSAGE_BATCH_TIMEOUT_MS`
- Format:
  ```
  [Batch of 5 messages from #general]
  1. [username (id=123) mentioned you] message text
  2. [username2 (id=456)] another message
  ...
  ```

This reduces API calls and provides better conversation context for active channels.

### Timer/Heartbeat

When enabled, the bot sends periodic heartbeat events to the agent:

- Fires at random intervals between 1 minute and `TIMER_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
- Only fires based on `FIRING_PROBABILITY` (default 10%)
- Requires `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` to know where to send responses
- Allows the agent to initiate conversations or update memory autonomously

### Image Handling

When `ENABLE_IMAGE_HANDLING=true`, image attachments in Discord messages are forwarded to the agent:

- Supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP formats
- Images are base64 encoded and sent as multi-modal content
- Images over 5MB are skipped
- Requires a multi-modal capable model on your Letta agent

### Voice Transcription

When `ENABLE_VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION=true`, Discord voice messages are transcribed and sent as text:

- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set
- Requires `ffmpeg` installed on the system (to convert OGG to MP3)
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` model by default (configurable via `OPENAI_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`)
- Voice messages over 25MB are skipped
- Graceful fallback if ffmpeg is not installed

### User-Specific Memory Blocks

When `ENABLE_USER_BLOCKS=true`, the bot dynamically attaches user-specific memory blocks:

- Creates/attaches a dedicated memory block for each Discord user mentioned in a message
- Blocks are attached before sending to the agent, detached after response
- Allows the agent to maintain per-user notes and context
- Periodic cleanup sweep removes orphaned blocks (configurable interval)
